##### PROJECT OBJECTIVE: 
The objective of the project is to create a machine learning model. I have done by using supervised learning and our aim is to do predictive analysis to predict house price to assist both buyers and sellers in making informed decisions using Linear Regression.
##### DATA DESCRIPTION:
Data is taken from Kaggle which is Bangluru_House_Data. The dataset comprising various features such as area type, price, location, size and other relevant factors affecting house prices in the city.

##### Features: 
*	Area type – describes the area
*	Availability – when it can be possessed or when it is ready (categorical and time-series)
*	Location – where it is located in Bengaluru
*	Price – Value of the property in lakhs (INR)
*	Size – in BHK or Bedroom 
*	Society – to which society it belongs
*	Total_sqft – size of the property in sq. ft
*	Bath – No. of bathrooms
*	Balcony – No. of the balcony
##### TOOLS & LIBRARY:
-	Jupyter Notebook: The Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computing platform. The notebook combines live code, equations, narrative text, visualizations
-	Scikit learn: Scikit-learn is a free software machine learning library for the Python programming language. It features various classification, regression and clustering algorithms including support-vector machines, random forests, gradient boosting, k-means classification  and is designed to interoperate with the Python numerical and scientific libraries NumPy and SciPy.
-	Python(>3.6): Python is a very popular programming language
-	NumPy: NumPy (Numerical Python) is a library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level mathematical functions to operate on these arrays.
-	Pandas: Pandas is a software library written for the Python programming language for data manipulation and analysis. In particular, it offers data structures and operations for manipulating numerical tables and time series
-	Seaborn: Seaborn is an amazing visualization library for statistical graphics plotting in Python. It provides beautiful default styles and colour palettes to make statistical plots more attractive. It is built on top matplotlib library and is also closely integrated with the data structures from pandas.
Seaborn aims to make visualization the central part of exploring and understanding data.
-	Mat plot: Matplotlib is a plotting library for the Python programming language and its numerical mathematics extension NumPy
##### PROCESS:
-	Import libraries like scikit learn, NumPy, pandas, seaborn and mat plot
-	Load the data
-	Data cleaning 
-	Train model
-	Test model
